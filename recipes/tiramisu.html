        <li>2 cups white sugar</li>
        <li>4 eggs</li>
        <li>4 egg yolks</li>
        <li>1/8 teaspoon salt</li>
        <li>1 cup unsalted butter, cut into cubes</li>
        <li>1/2 teaspoon vanilla extract</li>
        <li>1 1/2 cups white sugar</li>
        <li>3 (1-inch) strips of lemon peel</li>
        <li>1/2 cup lemon juice</li>
        <li>2/3 cup limoncello liqueur</li>
        <li>2 cups heavy cream</li>
        <li>1/2 cup powdered sugar</li>
        <li>24 ounces mascarpone cheese</li>
        <li>1 tablespoon lemon zest</li>
        <li>10 ounces crisp ladyfingers (about 39 larger or 57 smaller ladyfingers)</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Gather Ingredients.</li>
        <li>For Lemon Curd: Combine lemon juice, 2 cups white sugar, eggs, egg yolks, and salt in a large non-reactive saucepan.</li>
        <li>Cook, stirring constantly, over medium until mixture thickens and starts to bubble. Cook over medium-low heat for 2 minutes more. Remove from heat.</li>
        <li>Strain through a fine mesh sieve into a medium bowl.</li>
        <li>Stir in butter and vanilla. Cover surface with plastic wrap. Refrigerate 1 to 2 hours or until chilled**. (Lemon curd can be made up to a week ahead.) Reserve 1/4 cup lemon curd before assembling tiramisu.</li>
        <li>For Syrup: Combine 1 1/2 cup sugar, lemon peel, lemon juice and limoncello in a small non-reative* saucepan. Bring to a boil over medium-high heat, stirring occasionally. Cook until sugar melts.</li>
        <li>Discard the lemon peel. Transfer syrup to a glass bow or 4-cup glass measuring cup. Set syrup aside to cool.</li>
        <li>For Mascarpone Layer: Beat cream and powdered sugar in a large bowl until stiff peaks form. Set aside.</li>
        <li>Beat mascarpone and lemon zest in an extra-large bowl until combined and creamy. Fold in 3/4 cup lemon curd.</li>
        <li>Fold the whipped cream into the mascarpone mixture in three batches, folding gently until everything is combined.</li>
        <li>Arrange half of the  ladyfingers in a single layer on the bottom of a 9x13-inch baking dish, trimming ladyfingers as needed. Generously brush or drizzle half the syrup over the ladyfingers.</li>
        <li>Top the ladyfingers with half of the remaining lemon curd.</li>
        <li>Layer half of the mascarpone filling over lemon curd.</li>
        <li>Repeat with remaining lady fingers, lemon curd, and mascarpone filling.</li>
        <li>Drizzle reserved lemon curd over tiramisu. (You will use about 10 oz. ladyfingers. Save remaining ladyfingers for another purpose.)</li>
        <li>Cover with plastic wrap and chill in the refrigerator at least 8 hours or overnight before serving. Slice and enjoy!</li>
    </ol>
